\section{Introduction}

Synthesizing formally verified controllers for safety-critical dynamical systems has emerged as an important problem.
The goal is to algorithmically synthesize controllers so that the systems under control only do what they are meant to do, even in the presence of external disturbances.
One such algorithmic technique is the so-called Abstraction-Based Controller Design (ABCD).
In ABCD, we start with a model of a continuous nonlinear dynamical system and a control task.
The sought controller is synthesized in three stages:
First, we approximate the continuous system model using a finite state abstraction.
Second, we compute an abstract controller for the abstraction by using reactive synthesis techniques.
Third, we refine the abstract controller to the sought final controller for the continuous system.
The desired correctness guarantee of the obtained controller follows from a careful abstraction construction process.

The strengths of ABCD are its versatility: 
It can handle arbitrary continuous nonlinear system models, external disturbances, modeling uncertainties, measurement errors, $\omega$-regular control specifications, and so on.
The weakness of ABCD is its poor scalability: 
Usually ABCD uses a state-space discretization for computing the abstraction, which causes an exponential blow-up in the time and space complexity.

In this paper, we extend ABCD---more in a practical sense---to synthesis of decentralized controllers for a group of robots, operating in a shared workspace.
In general, the group can consist of a heterogeneous mix of robotic systems.
We do not require the robots to be able to communicate during runtime.
We assume that each robot has been assigned a reach-avoid task, where the robot needs to reach a set of target states while avoiding a set of static obstacles.
Moreover, each robot is required to avoid collision with other moving robots by maintaining a minimum safe distance.
The synthesis problem is then to algorithmically come up with controllers for each robot such that all these requirements are fulfilled for all the robots.
