We consider the decentralized controller synthesis problem for multi-agent control systems for joint reach-avoid specifications.
Each control system is modeled as a nonlinear dynamical system with disturbance, the control objective is to synthesize \emph{local}
feedback controllers that guarantee that the overall system meets the specification even under the influence of disturbances.
%
Existing techniques based on planning or trajectory optimization usually ignore the effects of disturbance and produce open-loop
\emph{nominal} trajectories which may not suffice in the presence of disturbances.
Techniques based on formal synthesis of temporal controllers do not scale as the number of agents increase.

We propose a two-level solution approach that combines fast global nominal trajectory generation and local application of formal synthesis.
At the top level, we ignore the effect of disturbances and obtain a joint open-loop plan for the system using a fast trajectory optimizer.
At the lower level, we use abstraction-based controller design to synthesize a set of decentralized feedback controllers 
that track the high level plan against worst-case disturbances.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several multi-robot examples using two particular classes of control specifications.
In the first type, we assume that the robots need to fulfill their own reach-avoid tasks while avoiding collision with the other robots.
In the second type, we require the robots to fulfill reach-avoid tasks while maintaining certain formation constraints.
Our experiments show that the combination technique is able to produce formally guaranteed feedback controllers while scaling to many robots.
In contrast, nominal open loop controllers did not guarantee the property and formal synthesis approaches did not finish.
