\section{Discussion and Future Work}
We have presented a method for synthesizing provably correct decentralized controllers for multi-agent systems with global reach-avoid specifications. 
Our approach is hierarchical. 
At the top level, we obtain a high-level joint plan by solving a centralized synthesis problem on a simplified model of the product system, 
and at the bottom level we synthesize local controllers for robustly tracking the high-level plan for each individual agent.
In this section, we discuss different features of our work, limitations, and future work.

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Scalability of the proposed method.}\
We compute the reference trajectory for the product system using ALTRO. 
Our experiments show that ALTRO generates reference trajectories for high-dimension systems quite fast. 
On the other hand, for tracking controllers, our method synthesizes controllers in a decentralized manner and 
thus scalability is not affected by increasing the number of agents. 
We use SCOTS for computing tracking controllers because the algorithm can be effectively parallelized \cite{KhaledZ19pfaces}. 
While \tool uses ALTRO and SCOTS for solving the given reach-avoid problem, 
one could replace them with any other off-the-shelf method that can perform similar tasks.

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Extension to richer classes of specifications.}\
Our proposed method is specific to reach-avoid specifications but it can be extended to other specifications by 
decomposing them into a sequence of reach-avoid tasks. 
To that end, one can use high-level languages (e.g., \cite{Majumdar2020,Ghosh2020}) for specifying complex reach-avoid 
sequences and invoke \tool to solve each individual reach-avoid task.

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Choice of parameters.}\
Our algorithm takes as input the robustness margin $\varepsilon$ and the abstraction parameters $\eta_x$ and $\eta_u$.
The larger the value of $\varepsilon$, more difficult it is to synthesize a nominal controller for the product system using ALTRO.
On the other hand, the smaller the value of $\varepsilon$, the more difficult it is to synthesize a set of decentralized controllers using SCOTS.
Also, there is a trade-off between computation time and ease of synthesis when it comes to choosing the parameters $\eta_x$ and $\eta_u$ for SCOTS:
Larger values of these parameters will result in faster computation but there may be no solution to the synthesis problem.
It is not always easy to come up with a good set of parameters.
Our current approach adds an outer loop around our tool to search for suitable parameters until the decentralized synthesis is successful.
We do not know a good heuristic to systematically explore the parameter space by analyzing the dynamics of the systems.
